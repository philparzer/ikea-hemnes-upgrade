3D printable upgrades / modifications for Ikea Hemnes beds that slide right on; no drilling needed <div>(IKEA HEMNES https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/hemnes-day-bed-frame-with-3-drawers-white-90349326/)</div>

## Content

This repo contains a blend file with all current modular upgrade pieces, base pieces as well as primitives, that you can use to easily create your own Hemnes modifications. The subfolder STL contains exported .stl files of existing models.

## Printing

Expect having to do some cleanup work after your print is done. I used a Prusa Mini, Prusa Slicer (10-20% infill, speed-setting) and GIANTARM Wood filament. Make sure to have a few furniture sliders (<=0.18 cm thick) at hand to avoid scratches.
