# HEMNES UPGRADES

3D printable upgrades / modifications for Ikea Hemnes beds that can slide right on; no drilling needed <div>(IKEA HEMNES https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/hemnes-day-bed-frame-with-3-drawers-white-90349326/)</div>

## Content
This repo contains a blend file with all current models and primitives, that you can use to easily create your own Hemnes modifications.
STL files still need some testing.

## Printing
Expect having to do some cleanup work after your print is done. I used a Prusa Mini and GIANTARM Wood filament. Make sure to have a few furniture sliders at hand to avoid scratches.
